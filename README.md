Stanford CS 109 Notes
====================

Comprehensive notes for Stanford's CS 109 probability course, as taught by Mehran Sahami. Typeset in LaTeX, using the [CS 109 problem set template](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs109/handouts/ps_blank.tex) in a MacTeX distribution.

`distros.[tex|pdf]` is a summary of all of the random variables covered in the course.

`studysheet.[tex|pdf]` is an overarching summary of (almost) all the concepts covered in the course, through to the "Helpful Theorems" lectures on useful inequalities.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments, and pull requests are more than welcome.
